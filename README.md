# Alta Typst

A simple Typst CV template, inspired by [AltaCV by LianTze Lim](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV). [LaurenzV's simplecv](https://github.com/LaurenzV/simplecv) was used as a Typst code reference. See [`example.pdf`](example.pdf) for the rendered PDF output.

The layout is two columns, with one wrapping into the next when space runs out. If you'd like to force an early column or page break, you can use the `#colbreak()` command.

## Usage

### With [Typst CLI](https://github.com/typst/typst)

Fork and clone this repo, then run `typst watch example.typ`.

Note that the template is intended for use with the IBM Plex Sans font, which isn't currently bundled with the Typst CLI â€” so the rendered output on your machine may differ slightly. You can run `typst fonts` to see which fonts can be used instead.

#### HTML export

As of Typst 0.14.0, if you compile with `typst watch --format html --features html example.typ`, you'll get some mostly unstyled HTML output (see `example.html`). This can be then embedded into your website, and will hopefully pick up styling from there. Typst makes a standalone document, i.e. valid HTML doc including `<head>` and <body> -- if you plan to embed the output you'll want to strip these out.

### On [typst.app](https://typst.app/)

Upload both the `.typ` files and the `icons/` folder to your Typst project, then see `example.typ`. Uploading folders to the web app is unsupported, but you can select multiple files at once.

### Icons

Add extra icons by uploading more `.svg` files to the `icons/` folder. The existing icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free). You can then reference their file names as the `name` values in the `links` array passed into the `alta` function.
